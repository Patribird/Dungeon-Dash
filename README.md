## About
Dungeon Dash is a turn-based dungeon exploration game where you can choose between 3 unique
classes. There's the mighty Warrior: fierce in battle with the special ability Crushing Blow!
The knieving Theif: monsters will never know you're next move with Surprise Attack! And last,
but certainly not least, the Priestess: save yourself in dire straits with her Recovery ability!

The depths are a dangerous place! Make sure you use your health potions and vision potions wisely...
the gremlins, skeletons, and ogres (oh my!) don't take kindly to us humans. Battle your way
through the dungeon and collect the four mythical pillars of Object Oriented Programming!
Escape, if you can!
